h2. TODO

Current list of shit that needs doing.

h3. Quick Wins
none

h3. Stage One
* Implement the tagging system
* Implement searching for projects... Solr???
* Implement the details page:
  * If the project is "not ready" display a friendly message 
  * If the project does not exist ask the user to add it
* Implement the list of all projects
* Implement the list of all tags

h3. Stage Two
* Implement asynchronous project setup. Add an isReady flag to the Project definition and then make the calls to the github API asynchronous (number of followers, number of forks, number of contributions, list of contributors).
* Implement the "most popular" projects (currently thinking to note the number of followers a repo has and then sort by that?)
* Do a validation on the group ID and artefact ID with the repository URL - download the POM file to check dependencies? 

h3. Initial Release

Speculative date: End of October

h3. Profit
