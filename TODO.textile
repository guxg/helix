h2. TODO

Current list of shit that needs doing.

h3. Quick Wins
* None. is anything every easy? ;-) .

h3. Random Thoughts
* What about making the projects service based?:
  GET /project/com.twitter/gizzard - Displays the project via the UI
  PUT /project/com.twitter/gizzard - Would update the existing project or create a new one
  POST /project/com.twitter/gizzard/0.1.2 - Add a new project version (append only)
  
* How about making versions based upon a case class rather than a limited map?:
case class Version(number: String, description: String, scalaVersions: List[ScalaVersion])

h3. Stage One
* Implement searching for projects... Solr??? <-- Massively important (lolz)
* Project editing for contributors to a particular project
* Redo the project addition workflow
* Multi-module projects?

h3. Stage Two
* Do a validation on the group ID and artefact ID with the repository URL - download the POM file to check dependencies? 
* Implement the list of all tags

h3. Initial Release
Speculative date: End of October

h3. Profit

?
