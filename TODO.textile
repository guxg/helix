h2. TODO

* Implement the "most popular" projects thing (currently thinking to note the number of followers a repo has and then sort by that?)
* Implement the details page
* Project versions and Scala version compatibility
* Make the github OAuth redirect back to the original referrer so the user does not always get redirect back to the home page. this is annoying.
