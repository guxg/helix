* Implement the "most popular" projects thing (currently thinking to note the number of followers a repo has and then sort by that?)
* Implement the details page
* Remove any checking for cookies - this is a mostly read-only site so cookies are pointless.
* Do a validation on the group ID and artefact ID with the repository URL
