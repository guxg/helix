h2. TODO

* Implement the "most popular" projects thing (currently thinking to note the number of followers a repo has and then sort by that?)
* Implement the details page
* Sort out the parsing of the access token cookie so its not nessicary to continually login
* Do a validation on the group ID and artefact ID with the repository URL
