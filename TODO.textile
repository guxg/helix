h2. TODO

* Invoke the contributors API to get a list of the contributors to stuff into the db when the project is registered (https://api.github.com/repos/lift/framework/contributors)
* Contributor avatars on the home page - randomly cycle from those in the project
* Implement the "most popular" projects thing (currently thinking to note the number of followers a repo has and then sort by that?)
* Implement the details page
* Project versions and Scala version compatibility
